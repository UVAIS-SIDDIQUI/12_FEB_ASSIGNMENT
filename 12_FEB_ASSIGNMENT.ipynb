    "Syntax errors, also known as parsing errors, occur when the Python interpreter encounters code that does not follow the language's syntax rules.\n",
    "These errors prevent the code from being parsed and compiled, so the program cannot even start executing.\n",
    "Common examples of syntax errors include misspelled keywords, missing colons, mismatched parentheses, etc.\n",
    "Syntax errors are caught by the Python interpreter during the initial parsing phase, and they must be fixed before the program can run.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exceptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "Exceptions, on the other hand, occur during the runtime of a program when an operation cannot be executed as intended.\n",
    "Exceptions can be caused by various factors like dividing by zero, trying to access an index that does not exist in a list, or attempting to open a file that doesn't exist.\n",
    "Unlike syntax errors, exceptions are not detected during the initial parsing phase, and the program starts executing before they are raised.\n",
    "If an exception is not handled with appropriate error-handling mechanisms (like using try-except blocks), it will lead to an abrupt termination of the program."
